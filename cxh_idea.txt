Roadmap for CX-Hibernate
========================

Still to do:
------------
Version 0.7: Follow associations
Version 0.8: Derived classes in class-hierarchy table
Version 0.9: Derived classes in their own table
Version 1.0: First stable version + Documentation


Features that will not go into 1.0
But will be implemented in a later version
------------------------------------------
- Naming the discriminator attribute other than "Discriminator"
- Other generators than a native database "SEQUENCE"
- Other generator names than "<classname>_seq"
- Greater cache control. Especially on the second line cache
- many-to-many associations


Features from (N)Hibernate that will NEVER be implemented:
----------------------------------------------------------
- Lazy loading: too many runtime problems at customer sites
- Automatic reflection: cannot be done in C++, but pending 
  requests on the ISO C++ commities exist.
